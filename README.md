# Sandeep Malviya - Portfolio

> **Tactile Intelligence:** Bridging the gap between high-performance mobile engineering and rigorous data science.

## About Me

I am a **Data Scientist** and **Mobile Engineer** based in Exeter, UK, recently graduating with an **MSc in Data Science (Distinction)** from the University of Exeter (Sept 2025).

My journey began in mobile development, where I spent over 2 years architecting Flutter applications and shipping products that solved real-world problems. Today, I leverage that engineering rigor to build advanced Machine Learning models and data-driven solutions.

I don't just train models; I understand the systems that generate the data and the interfaces that deliver the insights.

**Core Competencies:**
- **Data Science:** Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Computer Vision (CNNs), SQL
- **Engineering:** Flutter, React, AWS/GCP, Docker, Real-time Systems (MQTT/BLE)

## Portfolio Features

This interactive portfolio is built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, featuring:

*   **AI Persona Chat:** Chat with an AI version of me, powered by **Google Gemini**, capable of answering questions about my resume, projects, and technical skills in my specific tone of voice.
*   **3D Interactive Gallery:** A custom-built project showcase with tilt-effect cards and glassmorphism UI.
*   **Engineering Deep Dives:** Detailed case studies for each project, highlighting complexity, architecture, and code snippets.
*   **Live GitHub Feeds:** Automatic fetching of my latest open-source work.
